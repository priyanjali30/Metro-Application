# Metro-Application
This project is used to find the shortest and most economical route the passenger will take to reach the destination. It can also be used to calculate the fare and time depending on the distance travelled by the passenger. This is implemented using graphs and Djiktra's Algorithm which is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph which in this case represents a network of metro stations.

Application:
1. Calculation of the Fare - This application will give a fair idea about the fare of the metro. This project is limited to Delhi and has the price according to Delhi    Metro.
   This will give a predefined idea about the money needed to go from one metro station to another.

2. Calculating the shortest distance between two metro stations- Delhi Metro has a vast network of metro stations and connects different areas of Delhi via different    lines such as yellow line, pink line, violet line, red line etc. For a newly delhi tourist it is hard to find the correct route to be taken so that less time is      required to reach the destination. Through this application it will be easy to calculate the shortest distance between two points.
